The files in this directory are an example of using JSNes with multitouch.

All you need is a web page that loads jquery, hammer.js, jquery.hammer.js, and jsnes.js (only tested with jsnes-source.js)

Caveat: JSNes is really slow on iOS and android.

The way to get the touch buttons on the screen are to provide html elements with the following ids:
a_button
b_button
start_button
select_button
up_button
down_button
left_button
right_button

newing up the JSNES object will automatically install the tap/hold/release functions for the above html elements.

Enjoy!
